The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game that has been implemented in Java using the Swing library. The game involves controlling a snake, which grows longer as it consumes food, and the objective is to avoid collisions with the game borders and the snake's own body. This project provides an interactive and entertaining gaming experience.



KEY FEATURES


1. Responsive User Interface:
The Snake Game project features a responsive and visually appealing user interface. The game window includes a title, a well-defined gameplay area, and a clear score display. The use of images for the snake, enemy, and other elements enhances the overall graphical presentation, contributing to a positive user experience.

2. Dynamic Game Logic:
The game incorporates dynamic and engaging logic to drive the gameplay. Users control the snake's movement using arrow keys, and the snake's length increases upon consuming randomly generated enemies. Collision detection mechanisms are implemented to prevent the snake from colliding with the game borders or itself. This dynamic game logic creates an interactive and challenging gaming experience.

3. Scoring System:
A scoring system is integrated into the game, providing feedback to the player on their performance. The score is incremented each time the snake successfully consumes an enemy. 


4. User Controls:
Intuitive and responsive user controls are a key feature of the Snake Game. Arrow keys are used to control the snake's direction, allowing players to navigate through the game environment. Additionally, the spacebar serves as a convenient control for restarting the game after encountering a game over scenario. The simplicity and effectiveness of the control scheme contribute to an accessible and enjoyable gaming experience.

5. Game Over Screen and Restart Option:
Upon the conclusion of a game, a game over screen is presented to the player. This screen displays a bold "Game Over!" message along with the player's final score. Furthermore, instructions to restart the game are provided, indicating that the spacebar can be pressed to initiate a new game. This feature enhances the user interface and allows for seamless transitions between gameplay sessions.
